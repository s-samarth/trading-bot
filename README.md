# Trading Bot

An automated trading bot that integrates with multiple trading platforms including Upstox, Zerodha, and Angel One.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note**: Currently, only the Upstox API integration is fully functional and operational. Other platform integrations are under development.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Upstox API integration (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Automated ChromeDriver management
- üöß Zerodha integration (coming soon)
- üöß Angel One integration (coming soon)
- Secure configuration management
- Telegram notifications
- Automated trading strategies

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n trading_env python=3.13.2
conda activate trading_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Upstox Account Setup (Required)

Before proceeding with configuration, you must set up TOTP authentication in your Upstox account:

1. Log in to your Upstox account
2. Navigate to the security settings
3. Enable TOTP-based Authentication
4. **IMPORTANT**: When the TOTP QR code is displayed, look for the key shown below or next to the QR code
5. Save this key - this will be your `UPSTOX_TOTP_SECRET` in the configuration

Without completing this TOTP setup, the bot will not be able to authenticate with Upstox.

### 3. Configuration Setup

The project uses a secure configuration system that keeps sensitive data out of version control.

a) First, copy the template files:
```bash

# Copy template files
cp config/secrets/upstox.template.json config/secrets/upstox.json
```

b) Edit the Upstox configuration file with your credentials:

**Upstox Configuration** (`config/secrets/upstox.json`):
```json
{
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "api_secret": "your_api_secret",
    "redirect_uri": "your_redirect_uri",
    "mobile_number": "your_mobile",
    "totp_secret": "your_totp_secret",  # The key from TOTP QR setup
    "mpin": "your_mpin",
    "postback_url": "optional_postback_url",
    "sandbox_access_token": "optional_sandbox_token"
}
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical**: The `totp_secret` must be copied from the Upstox TOTP setup screen when enabling TOTP authentication. This key appears under or alongside the QR code.

### 4. Environment and ChromeDriver Setup

Run the setup script to:
- Configure environment variables
- Download and install the appropriate ChromeDriver version
- Cache the driver location
- Set up automatic driver updates
- Configure headless mode (default: enabled)

```bash
python SetupEnv.py
```

Note: You can also manually manage ChromeDriver if needed:
```bash
python ChromeDrivers/ChromeDrivers.py
```

### 5. Run the Bot

```bash
cd TradingStrategy
python demo.py
```

## Future Platform Support

While only Upstox is currently functional, we plan to add support for:

### Zerodha Setup (Coming Soon)

2. Enable TOTP if not already enabled
3. Configure the redirect URI in your Zerodha developer settings

### Angel One Setup (Coming Soon)

2. Generate your API credentials
3. Configure the redirect URI in your Angel One settings

### Telegram Setup (Optional)
